### Job
Right now I work as Partner Support Manager at Dodo Brands. I spearheaded an internal fraud investigation in partnership with the anti-fraud team. By developing a suspect's behavioral profile, I enabled precise SQL data extraction. My subsequent manual analysis of the dataset identified the responsible employee. Collaborating with the leadership team, we contributed to the termination decision and drove improvements to internal security measures.  

## Personal info
